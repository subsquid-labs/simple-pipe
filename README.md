# simple-pipe

A small Solana data pipe powered by Soldexer. Gets the balances of USDT wallets that moved the token and computes hourly averages. Can be used to track the relative dominance of large vs small players chainwide.

See the [Soldexer pipes overview](https://docs.soldexer.dev/pipes/overview) as well as `src/main.ts` and `src/transfers.sql` for details.

This software is in early beta. Interfaces of the components involved can change without notice.

## Running the pipe

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Start ClickHouse
docker compose up -d

# Start the swaps indexer
yarn ts-node src/main.ts
```
You can now visit the local [ClickHouse console](http://localhost:8123/play) and observe the data that the pipe produces:
```sql
select * from transfers_raw;
```
```sql
-- see https://clickhouse.com/docs/materialized-view/incremental-materialized-view
select timestamp, avgMerge(avg_active_wallet_balance) from active_balance_stats group by timestamp;
```
